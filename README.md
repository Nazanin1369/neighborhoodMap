### Neighborhood Map

This project contains the source code of the implementation of the Fifth project assigment from Udacity's Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree: Neighborhood map.

The project consists of developing a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a 
neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, 
including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, 
a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. 
You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of 
these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).
